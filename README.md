**Remote Stepmotor with a LDR Sensor:**

This is a school project. Our task was to control the stepper motors with an LDR sensor. This means that if the LDR sensor does not get any light, it should control itself to the light.

Needed components:
- LDR Sensor 
- Stepmotor
- Capacitor

Important:
We used 4 LDR sensors and 2 stepmotors in our project.
